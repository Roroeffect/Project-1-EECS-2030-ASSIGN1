INTRODUCTION
------------

The code consists of algorithms to guide a self driving car from a radnom point on a grid to to the border of the grid using the principles of recursion in java.
The self driving car, which is left at a random intersection, is given the instruction to drive to a particular intersection. The car should be able to find the shortest path from the source intersection to the destination intersection. 
It is assumed that intersections have an equal distance from each other
